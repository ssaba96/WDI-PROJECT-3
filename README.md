### Overview

Using this application, the users can view the different categories of  museums, its location and leave reviews.


### Project Brief

Your app must:
- Use Mongo, Node & Express to build a server-side API
- Your API must have at least 2 related models, one of which should be a user 
- Your API should include all RESTFUL actions for at least one of those models 
- Include authentication to restrict access to appropriate users 
- Include at least one referenced or embedded sub-document, however don't go crazy! You need to manage your time effectively...
- Include automated tests for at least one resource

###### Museum Show Page: Once a museum is clicked, the user can then see the information about it including images, reviews and directions to the museum. In order to leave a review themselves, user has to login first by clicking 'Login' in the navbar. If the user is not already registered, they can do so by clicking 'Register' in the navabar.

### Challenges and Problems

- It was challenging to implement the carousel on home page images.

- The avatar did not change on the navbar when it was changed in the user's profile page.

---

### Wins

- I was able to make user's comment and rating to post under review section.

- The google map displayed the correct location of the museum.

---

### Future Features

Features I would have liked to include:

- I would like google maps to display full address of the museum i.e. postcode.
